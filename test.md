When the momentum of an electron is reduced by 50%, its kinetic energy decreases significantly. Hereâ€™s the detailed explanation in markdown:

### Mathematical Relationship

The kinetic energy (\( KE \)) of an electron is related to its momentum (\( p \)) by the following equation:

\[ KE = \frac{p^2}{2m} \]

where:
- \( KE \) is the kinetic energy,
- \( p \) is the momentum,
- \( m \) is the mass of the electron.

### Reduction in Momentum

If the electron's momentum is reduced by 50%, the new momentum (\( p' \)) is:

\[ p' = \frac{p}{2} \]

### New Kinetic Energy

Using the new momentum, the new kinetic energy (\( KE' \)) can be calculated as:

\[ KE' = \frac{(p')^2}{2m} \]
\[ KE' = \frac{\left(\frac{p}{2}\right)^2}{2m} \]
\[ KE' = \frac{p^2}{8m} \]

### Comparison with Original Kinetic Energy

Comparing this with the original kinetic energy (\( KE = \frac{p^2}{2m} \)):

\[ KE' = \frac{1}{4} KE \]

### Conclusion

Therefore, when the momentum of an electron is reduced by 50%, its kinetic energy is reduced to one-fourth of its original value. This significant reduction is due to the squared relationship between momentum and kinetic energy.
